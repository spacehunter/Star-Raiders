  "task_description": "Let's refactor the players weapon the way he fires. Right now it's just one little beam of torpedo or what have you that goes straight to the screen from the middle of the screen. In the traditional game there were called photo photon cannons. That's what they should be called here. And there was actually two of them that fire from each side of the spacecraft. So the port side and the starboard side. They were shooting the angle towards the crosshairs in the center. Now what's interesting about this weapon it's unique being photon. It should be like it should look like a scrambled looking ball of fire or not ball of fire but a ball of miscellaneous pixel that you know goes up when they fire they both from the starboard in the port side lead straight up to the center of the screen of wherever the crosshairs are at that point. Obviously if they hit the enemy there should be an explosion. We need to pay real close attention to the photon torpedo what it looks like because when it fires it's like this energy ball that's scrambled as it animates towards the center. So pay attention to that.",
