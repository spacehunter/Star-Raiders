=== AUTO-BUILD PROGRESS ===

Project: Dual Photon Cannon Weapon System
Workspace: Star-Raiders
Started: 2026-01-02

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: Significant visual and mechanical enhancement to existing weapon system requiring new animation logic, trajectory calculations, and particle system implementation.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Created implementation_plan.json with 3 phases, 6 subtasks
- Created init.sh startup script
- Analyzed codebase patterns (VFXSystem, PhotonTorpedo, Player, Game)
- Identified key files to modify

Phase Summary:
- Phase 1 (Torpedo Visual): 2 subtasks, no dependencies
  - subtask-1-1: Replace mesh with particle system
  - subtask-1-2: Implement scrambled animation effect
- Phase 2 (Dual Firing): 2 subtasks, depends on Phase 1
  - subtask-2-1: Calculate port/starboard firing positions
  - subtask-2-2: Implement converging trajectory calculation
- Phase 3 (Integration): 2 subtasks, depends on Phase 2
  - subtask-3-1: Verify collision detection
  - subtask-3-2: Performance validation and cleanup

Services Involved:
- main (TypeScript/Three.js): Primary game implementation

Files to Modify:
- src/entities/PhotonTorpedo.ts: Replace sphere with scrambled particle system
- src/game/Game.ts: Dual firing from port/starboard with converging trajectories

Files Referenced (Patterns):
- src/systems/VFXSystem.ts: Particle system pattern (BufferGeometry, Points)
- src/entities/Player.ts: Ship dimensions (wing positions at x = +/-0.6)
- src/views/AttackComputer.ts: Crosshair at screen center

Key Technical Details:
- Port cannon: x = -0.6 units from ship center
- Starboard cannon: x = +0.6 units from ship center
- Convergence point: 50 units ahead at crosshair
- Particle count: 20 per projectile
- Colors: Cyan/blue range (#00FFFF to #0088FF)

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 1
- Recommended workers: 1
- Parallel groups: None (sequential dependencies)

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  cd /Users/moog/Documents/Star-Raiders && npm run dev

For the auto-claude orchestrator:

  source auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate && python auto-claude/run.py --spec 009 --parallel 1

=== SESSION 2 (Builder) ===
Date: 2026-01-02

Task: subtask-1-2 - Implement scrambled animation effect

Changes Made:
- Enhanced update() method in PhotonTorpedo.ts to include color variation
- Each frame, particles now randomly vary their green channel (0.5-1.0)
- Added colors array update with needsUpdate = true for animation
- Particles visibly shimmer with energy effect during flight

Implementation Details:
- Positions already scrambled (from subtask-1-1): random spherical coordinates
- Added color scrambling: R=0, G=0.5-1.0 random, B=1 (cyan/blue range)
- Both position and color buffers marked as needsUpdate each frame

Commit: a946aed - auto-claude: subtask-1-2 - Implement scrambled animation effect

Phase 1 (Photon Torpedo Visual Overhaul): COMPLETE ✓
- subtask-1-1: ✓ Replace mesh with particle system (commit b75011a)
- subtask-1-2: ✓ Implement scrambled animation effect (commit a946aed)

Progress: 2/6 subtasks (33%)
