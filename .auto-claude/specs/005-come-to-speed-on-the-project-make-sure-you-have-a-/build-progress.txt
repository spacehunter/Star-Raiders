Project: Star Raiders - Fix Galactic Chart Grid Dimensions
Spec: 005-come-to-speed-on-the-project
Workspace: /Users/moog/Documents/Star-Raiders
Started: 2026-01-02

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: Targeted fix requiring coordinated changes across multiple files (system, view, state) while preserving existing functionality.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Created implementation_plan.json
- Phases: 4
- Total subtasks: 8
- Created init.sh

Phase Summary:
- Phase 1 (Core System Updates): 3 subtasks, depends on []
  - Replace GRID_SIZE with GRID_WIDTH/GRID_HEIGHT
  - Update all grid iteration loops
  - Expand starbase placement regions
- Phase 2 (Rendering Updates): 3 subtasks, depends on [phase-1]
  - Update grid creation loop to 16×8
  - Update CSS grid template
  - Update cursor navigation bounds
- Phase 3 (Game State Updates): 1 subtask, depends on [phase-1]
  - Update player starting position to (8,4)
- Phase 4 (Integration Verification): 2 subtasks, depends on [phase-2, phase-3]
  - Verify TypeScript build
  - Visual verification of 16×8 grid

Files to Modify:
- src/systems/SectorSystem.ts (core grid constants and logic)
- src/views/GalacticChart.ts (rendering and cursor navigation)
- src/game/GameState.ts (player starting position)

Files to Reference:
- src/systems/StarbaseAttackSystem.ts (uses GRID_SIZE, will work with new constants)
- src/views/LongRangeScan.ts (not affected, uses real-time positions)
- src/systems/EnergySystem.ts (warp calculations, works with any coordinates)

Services Involved:
- main: Single TypeScript application (Vite + Three.js)

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 2
- Recommended workers: 1
- Parallel groups: [phase-2-rendering, phase-3-state] can run together

Key Changes Summary:
1. SectorSystem.ts Line 17:
   - Before: public static readonly GRID_SIZE = 8
   - After:  public static readonly GRID_WIDTH = 16
            public static readonly GRID_HEIGHT = 8

2. GalacticChart.ts Lines 244-245 (CSS):
   - Before: repeat(8, 1fr) for both
   - After:  repeat(16, 1fr) for columns, repeat(8, 1fr) for rows

3. GalacticChart.ts Lines 452-453 (cursor bounds):
   - Before: Math.min(7, ...)
   - After:  Math.min(15, cursorX + dx) for X
            Math.min(7, cursorY + dy) for Y

4. GameState.ts Lines 73, 95:
   - Before: sectorX = 4
   - After:  sectorX = 8 (center of 16-column grid)

Success Criteria:
- [ ] Grid displays 16 columns × 8 rows (128 total sectors)
- [ ] Cursor navigates to all corners: (0,0), (15,0), (0,7), (15,7)
- [ ] Player starts at sector (8, 4)
- [ ] Starbases spawn across full 16-column width
- [ ] No TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] No console errors during gameplay

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  source auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate && python auto-claude/run.py --spec 005 --parallel 1

Or to start the dev server manually:

  cd /Users/moog/Documents/Star-Raiders
  npm run dev

Then open http://localhost:5173 and press 'G' in-game to view the Galactic Chart.
