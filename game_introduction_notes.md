# Star Raiders - Introduction & Core Game Mechanics

## Story Context
The player is part of the ATARIAN STARSHIP FLEET - THE STAR RAIDERS. The mission involves battling interplanetary enemies across a galaxy divided into sectors displayed on a Galactic Chart.

## Conflict Setup
- Treaty between Atarian Federation and Zylon Empire has been broken
- Technical state of war exists
- Zylon Empire goal: eliminate humanity
- Player orders: DESTROY ALL ZYLON STARSHIPS ON SIGHT, SHOW NO MERCY

## Enemy Ship Types

### 1. Zylon Fighter
- Designed for high-speed attacks
- Deadly at close range
- Most common enemy type

### 2. Zylon Cruiser
- May have assigned patrol routes within a sector
- Will not attack unless provoked
- Mid-tier threat

### 3. Zylon Basestar
- Unlike other Zylon craft, equipped with shields
- Can only be destroyed with shields down
- Use extreme caution when attacking a BASESTAR
- Highest threat level

## Enemy Strategy
- Zylons avoid direct confrontation when clever
- They engage you in battle to distract while rest of fleet attacks starbases
- Friendly starbases are vital for survival
- Enemy is dangerous and diabolical

## Combat Mechanics

### Photon Torpedoes
- Burst of concentrated energy
- Completely destroys target upon contact

### Sector-Based Combat
- Player concerned only with enemy craft in current sector
- Can "hyperwarp" to any sector at any time
- When destroying enemy starship with photon torpedoes, that starship stays destroyed for remainder of mission

## Starbase System
- Friendly starbases allow player to stop for repairs
- Number of starbases is a mission-dependent on skill level
- Higher skill level = more starbases available
- Docking at starbase enables receiving new energy supply and repairing damaged/destroyed equipment

## Environmental Hazards

### Meteors
- Fly through space
- Must observe carefully during mission flights
- Meteor will destroy ship if it hits when shields are down
- When shields are up, meteor can still damage starship (except in NOVICE level)
- Possible to hyperwarp into meteor (causes damage/destruction)
- Can destroy meteor by hitting with photon torpedoes

## Mission Updates
- During each mission, receive updated information from computer on starship and equipment status
- Computer notifies if destroyed or damaged
- When damage occurs, player is on their own until repairs are made

## Difficulty Levels & Skill Progression
- Rating of rank depends on mission performance and skill development
- NOVICE level: Much tougher than higher levels, less going on
- Can work way up to PILOT, then WARRIOR
- Finally to COMMANDER (reserved for most skilled players)

## Game Depth
Star Raiders described as a game of depth and detail, requiring careful reading of instructions and familiarity with basic operations and joystick controls before playing.
