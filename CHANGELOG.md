I need more information to write accurate release notes. Could you provide:

1. **What is this product?** (e.g., a game, web app, mobile app)
2. **What features were actually added in version 1.0.1?**
3. **What bugs were fixed?**
4. **What changed from the previous version?**

The task description you mentioned appears incomplete. Once you provide the full details about what was changed, added, and fixed in this release, I can write clear, user-friendly release notes for you.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-02

### Changed
- Updated broadcast message animation to use a distinct 1-second flash pattern (1 second ON / 1 second OFF) for better visibility and clarity instead of the previous 0.8-second fade cycle
