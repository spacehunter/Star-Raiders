# Star Raiders - Control Panel Display and Systems

## Control Panel Display

The Control Panel Display appears at the bottom of the screen during gameplay and shows critical ship status information.

### Display Layout
The panel shows an "ORBIT ESTABLISHED" screen with indicators labeled:
- Two "A" markers on left and right sides
- Two "B" markers on left and right sides  
- Central display area showing status

### Information Displayed
- Energy levels (shown as numerical values)
- Damage status
- Ship systems status
- Current sector information
- Star date
- Score/rating information

## Sub-Space Radio
- Used to move from sector to sector
- Relays messages about starbase status
- Generates targets indicator on Galactic Chart
- If damaged, Galactic Chart will not be updated
- Communication functions are performed

## Attack Computer Display

### Purpose
Shows targeting information and lock-on status for photon torpedoes.

### Display Elements
- Rectangular frame with targeting reticle
- A, B, C lock-on indicators at specific positions
- Center crosshair for aiming
- Appears at bottom right during front view

### Lock-On System
- **A indicators**: Horizontal lock achieved
- **B indicators**: Horizontal and vertical lock achieved  
- **C indicators**: Full lock (horizontal, vertical, and range) - 90% kill probability

## Energy Systems

### Energy Usage
Energy is consumed by:
- Twin-Ion engines for movement
- Hyperwarp travel between sectors
- Shields (when activated)
- Photon torpedoes (minimal energy per shot)
- Sub-space radio communications

### Energy Management
- Monitor energy levels on Control Panel Display
- Must dock at starbases to recharge energy
- Running out of energy is mission-critical failure
- Strategic energy conservation is key to success

### Energy Drain Table
The documentation shows energy consumption rates:

**Random Speed** | **Unit Drain Per Second**
- Speed 1: 1.2
- Speed 2: 2
- Speed 3: 3
- Speed 4: 4
- Speed 5: 5
- Speed 6: 6
- Speed 7: 7
- Speed 8: 8
- Speed 9: 9

**Energy Drain per Jump (in units)**
- Values range from 100 to 2410 depending on distance

### Hyperwarp Energy Distance Table
Shows energy consumption for hyperwarp jumps:
- 1 jump: 100 units
- 2 jumps: 130 units
- 3 jumps: 190 units
- (continuing up to longer distances)

## Shields System (S key)

### Shield Operation
- Activated/deactivated with S key
- Protects ship from meteor impacts
- Protects from some enemy fire damage
- Consumes energy while active
- Cannot fire photons while shields are up (at some difficulty levels)

### Shield Strategy
- Raise shields when under attack or in meteor fields
- Lower shields to fire weapons
- Balance protection vs. offensive capability
- Monitor energy drain from shield usage

## Tracking Computer (T key)

### Purpose
Provides automatic targeting assistance for locating and tracking enemy vessels.

### Operation
- Activated with T key
- Helps locate enemies in current sector
- Assists with targeting during combat
- Works in conjunction with Attack Computer Display
- Essential for efficient combat

## Manual Target Selector (M key)

### Purpose
Allows manual selection and cycling through targets in the current sector.

### Operation  
- Press M to manually select targets
- Cycles through available enemy ships
- Useful when multiple enemies present
- Provides player control over target priority

## Starbase Docking

### Docking Procedure
When approaching a starbase:
1. Reduce speed using 0-9 engine controls
2. Carefully navigate to starbase
3. Align ship with docking port
4. Dock when properly positioned

### Starbase Services
When docked at starbase:
- Full energy recharge
- All damaged systems repaired
- Ship restored to full combat capability
- Mission can continue from refreshed state

### VI. STARBASE DOCKING Section Notes
The manual indicates there is a detailed section on starbase docking procedures, including:
- How to approach starbases safely
- Docking alignment requirements
- What services are provided
- When anything needs to be repaired or your starship needs energy supply, it is necessary to dock with a starbase

## Energy Drain for Hyperwarp
The documentation shows a detailed table correlating:
- Distance traveled (in sectors)
- Energy consumed (in units)
- Jump calculations for mission planning

This allows players to:
- Plan efficient routes
- Conserve energy for combat
- Avoid running out of energy mid-mission
- Make strategic decisions about which sectors to visit

## V. ENERGY USAGE Section
Detailed information about:
- How energy is consumed during different activities
- Energy requirements for various ship systems
- Strategic energy management
- When to seek starbase for recharging

## Orbit Established Display
The "ORBIT ESTABLISHED" screen appears when successfully docking at a starbase, showing the ship has safely arrived and is ready for repairs and refueling.
