- M = 100 | M = 95 | M = 70 | M = 70 | M = 70 | M = 70
- M = 111 | M = 105 | M = 80 | M = 80 | M = 80 | M = 80
- COMMANDER: M = 90

## IX. SURVIVAL TACTICS

### Basic Survival Strategy
- Move to another enemy target as fast as you can
- Destroy all enemy targets
- Use Galactic Chart to find enemy targets
- Like you have photon torpedoes, destroy all enemy targets

### In the Sector
- Raise your shields if you are in a sector
- If necessary, use the SHIFT button to bring up the Control Panel and check the status of your ship
- Move to another enemy target as fast as you can

### Combat Tactics
- Press F key to display the Galactic Chart
- Using the Galactic Chart, move the Hyperwarp destination dot to an enemy sector
- Press H key to engage Hyperwarp automatically to that sector

### COMMANDER Mission Warnings
- At level 3 (COMMANDER), it is reserved for the most aggressive STAR RAIDERS. There are 4 attributes and 4 primary dangers at the COMMANDER level: just getting through the mission at this level will be an accomplishment. There will be no more hand-holding or forgiving mistakes for the COMMANDER missions. Also, your targeting will be more difficult during these mission action periods.

### WARRIOR Mission Details
You can skip the Control Panel indicators for the Galactic Chart. Keep an eye on the Control Panel indicators and the Galactic Chart to find that you are 3 starbases and 45 enemy starships to contend with. There are 3 starbases and 45 enemy starships in this mission. You must move quickly since the enemy attacks will be frequent and possibly fatal.

### PILOT Mission
There are 3 starbases and 36 enemy starships in the PILOT mission. Your starship will be capable of energy attacks and you will find the mission more difficult in general.

### NOVICE Level
Keep an eye on the Control Panel indicators and the Galactic Chart to find that you are playing a mission level which is too ad-vanced for your skills. Switch to a lower skill level.

The mission ends when: (1) You destroy all enemy targets; (2) you run out of energy; or (3) your starship is destroyed.

**NOTE:** No damage can be inflicted on your starship in a NOVICE mission.
