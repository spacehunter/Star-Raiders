# Star Raiders - Long Range Scan and Advanced Mechanics

## Long Range Scan Display

### Overview
The Long Range Scan appears as a grid-based tactical display showing the current sector and surrounding space. The scan provides critical situational awareness for combat and navigation.

### Display Features
- Grid-based representation of space
- Shows player ship position (center)
- Displays enemy ship positions as icons
- Provides tactical overview of immediate area
- Blue/cyan colored grid interface

### Visual Elements
The scan shows:
- Player's starship in center position
- Enemy vessels as geometric shapes
- Spatial relationships between objects
- Sector boundaries and navigation reference

## Combat Imagery
The documentation shows dramatic combat scenes featuring:
- Player ship firing red photon torpedoes
- Enemy ship explosions with red/orange/white blast effects
- Photon beams connecting player ship to target
- High-contrast visual effects for weapon impacts
- Debris and explosion particles

## Hyperwarp and Navigation

### Hyperwarp Target Selection
- Select target sector on Galactic Chart
- Use Control Stick to move destination indicator
- Engage hyperwarp engines with H key
- Travel occurs between sectors via hyperspace

### Hyperwarp Engines Engaged
When hyperwarp is engaged:
- Ship travels to selected sector
- Energy is consumed during travel
- Important to monitor energy levels
- Frequent hyperwarping helps track enemy movements

## Enemy Starships

### Enemy Behavior
- Enemies will work even after they have been destroyed in previous missions
- They will be very slow, "the shields won't" work, however, pro-gress will be very slow
- Enemies attempt to surround and destroy starbases
- Enemy positions shift periodically

### Combat Strategy
- Use Computer Attack Control (C key) for targeting assistance
- Long Range Scan provides tactical positioning
- Attack Computer Display shows lock-on status
- Coordinate attacks using multiple display views

## Star Date System
The game tracks progress through a STAR DATE system displayed on the control panel, allowing players to monitor mission duration and enemy movements over time.

## Damage Control
When the Long Range Scan or other systems are damaged:
- Functionality is reduced or eliminated
- Must dock at starbase for repairs
- Damaged systems affect gameplay capabilities
- The sector detecting the Long Range Scan becomes unavailable

## Hyperwarp Limitations
- Cannot hyperwarp if engines are damaged
- Energy must be sufficient for travel distance
- Aborting hyperwarp uses 0-9 Twin-Ion Engine Control
- Strategic planning required for energy management

## Sector Types
From sector to sector, the player will encounter:
- Empty sectors (no targets)
- Sectors with varying numbers of enemy ships (1-4+)
- Sectors with friendly starbases
- Sectors where enemies are surrounding starbases (critical priority)

## NOVICE Level Notes
At the NOVICE level, you need:
- To hyperspace, then press H (Hyperwarp)
- The "star" in Hyperspace Flow will appear at the PILOT, WARRIOR, and COMMANDER levels
- Different visual effects for different skill levels
- Simpler combat scenarios to learn mechanics
